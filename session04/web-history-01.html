        <h2>History of the Web</h2>

        <h3>1983: Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn 1983</h3>
        <p>In May 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes. The authors had been working with Gérard Le Lann to incorporate concepts from the French CYCLADES project into the new network. The specification of the resulting protocol, RFC 675 (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), was written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, and published in December 1974. It contains the first attested use of the term internet, as a shorthand for internetwork. The Transmission Control Program incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. In version 4, the monolithic Transmission Control Program was divided into a modular architecture consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol. This resulted in a networking model that became known informally as TCP/IP, although formally it was variously referred to as the DoD internet architecture model (DoD model for short) or DARPA model. Later, it became the part of, and synonymous with, the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP continues to evolve, with incremental updates and best practices formalized in RFCs such as RFC 9293 (2022).</p>

        <h3>1989: Proposal of the World Wide Web</h3>
        <p>The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".[5][6][7] Documents and other media content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through a character string called uniform resource locator (URL).</p>

        <h3>1990: The first search engine Alan Emtage  Archie index</h3>
        <p>Archie first appeared in 1986, while Emtage was the systems manager at the McGill University School of Computer Science. His predecessor had attempted to persuade the institution to connect to the Internet, but due to the expensive cost — roughly $35,000 per year for a sluggish link to Boston — it had been challenging to persuade the appropriate parties that the investment was worthwhile. The name derives from the word "archive" without the 'v'. Emtage has said that contrary to popular belief, there was no association with the Archie Comics. Despite this, other early Internet search technologies such as Jughead and Veronica were named after characters from the comics. Anarchie, one of the earliest graphical FTP clients, was named for its ability to perform Archie searches.</p>

        <h3>1992: The first photo on the Internet Tim Berners-Lee 1992</h3>
        <p>Les Cernettes is the subject of the first photo of a band and one of the first photos on the Web. "Back in 1992, after their show at the CERN Hardronic Festival, my colleague Tim Berners-Lee asked me for a few scanned photos of 'the CERN girls' to publish them on some sort of information system he had just invented, called the 'World Wide Web'. I had only a vague idea of what that was, but I scanned some photos on my Mac and FTPed them to Tim's now famous 'info.cern.ch'. How was I to know that I was passing a historical milestone, as the one above was the first picture of a band ever to be clicked on in a web browser!" Silvano de Gennaro had taken the picture on July 18, 1992 with a Canon EOS 650.</p>

        <h3>1993: Mosaic Web Browser</h3>
        <p>NCSA Mosaic is a discontinued web browser that was instrumental in popularizing the World Wide Web and the general Internet during the 1990s. Although not the first web browser (preceded by WorldWideWeb, Erwise, and ViolaWWW), it was the first browser to display images inline with text instead of a separate window. It supported various Internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, NNTP, and Gopher.[8] Its interface, reliability, personal computer support, and simple installation contributed to Mosaic's initial popularity.</p>

        <h3>1994: Founding of Netscape</h3>
        <p>Mosaic was developed at the tax payer funded National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign beginning in late 1992. Mosaic became a private venture as Mosaic Communications Corporation on April 4, 1994, the brainchild of Jim Clark who had recruited Marc Andreessen as co-founder and Kleiner Perkins as investors. The first meeting between Clark and Andreessen was never truly about a software or service like Netscape, but more about a product that was similar to Nintendo. Clark recruited other early team members from SGI and NCSA Mosaic. Jim Barksdale came on board as CEO in January 1995. Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen created a 20-page concept pitch for an online gaming network to Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 console, but a deal was never reached.</p>

        <h3>1995: Introduction of Javascript</h3>
        <p>During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language. The goal was a "language for the masses", "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites". Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.</p>

        <h3>1997: The invention of Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 WIFI standard</h3>
        <p>802.11 technology has its origins in a 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that released the ISM band for unlicensed use. In 1991 NCR Corporation/AT&T (now Nokia Labs and LSI Corporation) invented a precursor to 802.11 in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. The inventors initially intended to use the technology for cashier systems. The first wireless products were brought to the market under the name WaveLAN with raw data rates of 1 Mbit/s and 2 Mbit/s. Vic Hayes, who held the chair of IEEE 802.11 for 10 years, and has been called the "father of Wi-Fi", was involved in designing the initial 802.11b and 802.11a standards within the IEEE. He, along with Bell Labs Engineer Bruce Tuch, approached IEEE to create a standard.</p>

        <h3>1998: Founding of Google</h3>
        <p>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California, United States. While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites. They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site. Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas. Page and Brin would also use their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage as their office when the search engine was set up in 1998.</p>

        <h3>1999-2000: The Browser Wars</h3>
        <p>A browser war is a competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The "first browser war" (1995–2001) occurred between Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, and the "second browser war" (2004–2017) between Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2008 and CSS 3 in 2011, a new generation of browser wars began, this time considering extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web (WWW), and the more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for web browsing. These changes have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected.</p>

        <h3>2004: Rise of Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>Web 2.0 (also known as participative (or participatory) web and social web) refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture, and interoperability (i.e., compatibility with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. A Web 2.0 website allows users to interact and collaborate through social media dialogue as creators of user-generated content in a virtual community. This contrasts the first generation of Web 1.0-era websites where people were limited to passively viewing content. Examples of Web 2.0 features include social networking sites or social media sites (e.g., Facebook), blogs, wikis, folksonomies ("tagging" keywords on websites and links), video sharing sites (e.g., YouTube), image sharing sites (e.g., Flickr), hosted services, Web applications ("apps"), collaborative consumption platforms, and mashup applications.</p>

        <h3>2005: Launch of YouTube</h3>
        <p>YouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was founded in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor. On December 17, 2005—the same week YouTube exited beta—NBCUniversal Saturday Night Live ran a sketch "Lazy Sunday" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for Saturday Night Live, "Lazy Sunday"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website. Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright concerns. Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content. The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.</p>

        <h3>2007: Mobile Web Revolution</h3>
        <p>The iPhone is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple as the first device in the iPhone lineup of smartphones. It features a Samsung S5L8900 SoC (90 nm), a 3.5 in multi-touch display, and a web browser (Safari). After years of rumors and speculation, it was officially announced on January 9, 2007, and was released in the United States on June 29, 2007. Development of the iPhone began in 2005 and continued in secrecy until its public unveiling at Macworld 2007. The device broke with prevailing mobile phone designs by eliminating most physical hardware buttons, and relying on a finger-friendly touchscreen interface that did not need a stylus. The iPhone featured quad-band GSM cellular connectivity with GPRS and EDGE support for data transfer, and it used continuous internet access and onboard processing to support features unrelated to voice communication.</p>
